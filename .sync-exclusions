# sync-exclusions
#
# This file lists files and directories to exclude from rsync during the
# Composer post-install command. The rsync task copies Bedrock's core files
# from the vendor directory into the project root.
#
# Files listed here are specific to the mattv8/bedrock-multisite-docker
# environment, containing custom settings or configurations that should not
# be overwritten during installation.
#
# The excluded files for the roots/bedrock Composer install are defined below:

.env
.env.example
.gitignore
LICENSE.md
README.md
phpcs.xml
config/*
